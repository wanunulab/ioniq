This package is under construction! &copy; 2024 The Wanunu Lab.

This is yet another nanopore signal analysis framework. Why? because we need custom analysis every frickin' day. From what we've observed, 10 different members in a lab need about 30 different analysis workflows, and we have hundreds of nanopore researchers around the world. This framework will provide modules and functionalities that they can piece together to build that custom workflow. But most experimentalists don't know how to code or don't want to; so we need the whole thing to work in a gui... and without a gui. Stay tuned as we figure it all out!
